BOLT gets its name from its main optimization: the Big Ol' Lookup Tables used
in puzzle solving. The solver processes the puzzle in 8x1 strips using the 
bitmap. It keeps another bitmap indicating which positions might be touching
the yet-explored part of the current island. At each step, the remaining land
in the current strip is combined with the corresponding "touching" strip to
get an index into the two 64KB lookup tables that were generated with a C#
program. The "transition" table determines what the new land value at the 
current position should be; the other determines the mask to binary-OR with
the vertically adjacent "touching" strips. Neighboring land-containing strips
are visited in a BFS (using a queue, no recursion). This strategy provides is
5.5 to 9 times faster than the given solver code and, since it's running nearly
all the time, gives BOLT a lot of money to work with.
